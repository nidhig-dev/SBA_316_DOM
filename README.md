## Objective
 Created a grocery List app. 
 ## Functionality
 
* Text box will let user add an item to the active list of groceries with a click of submit button.
* Delete button will delete the item from active list and add it to crossed off list with a strike through.
* Clicking on the crossed off item will delete the item from the crossed off list and put it back in the active list.

## Validation
- Check if text box is null or empty string
- Item name cannot start with number or special character
- Check for duplicate item names, if item is already in the list 
- Confirm before deleting an item

## Requirement

- ✅Cache at least one element using selectElementById.

- ✅Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.

- ✅Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).

- ✅Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task.

- ✅Create at least one element using createElement.

- ✅Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.

- ✅Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content. 

- ✅Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.

- ✅Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.

- ✅Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.

-✅ Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.

- ✅Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.

- ✅Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.

- ✅Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (This can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation.)

- ✅Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

- ✅Commit frequently to the git repository.

- ✅Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

- ✅Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.

## Reflection


- What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
   - I could have done better naming of all the elements I was creating.At one point, I got confused between all the ul and li that I created.

- What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

    - I would give user the option to add/subtract quantities of the item as well if given time
